# House_Price_Prediction

House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
A machine learning project that predicts house prices using the Ames Housing Dataset.
The model uses features like living area, bedrooms, bathrooms, total rooms, and neighborhood (label-encoded) to estimate house sale prices.

Key Steps:
1. Load and preprocess training data
2. Encode categorical features using LabelEncoder
3. Train–test split (80% / 20%)
4. Train a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate performance using RMSE
6. Generate predictions for Kaggle test data
7. Predict price for a custom example house

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

Purpose:
Demonstrates end-to-end regression workflow: preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-world prediction.
